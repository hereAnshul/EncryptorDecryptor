# EncryptorDecryptor
My 1st Year Project using C Programming Language
To encrypt press 'e' and there will be 2 mode if input Normal with visible character and with hidden character.
Once you encrypt the data the encrypted output get stored in file named enc.txt which can be used to decrypt by using 'd' to decrypt
For encryption the password need to be given by the user and end user must know the same.
For decryption there will be in built in password that can be altered.
